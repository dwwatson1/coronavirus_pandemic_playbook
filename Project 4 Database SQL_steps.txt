---------------------------------------------
1.	We input/imported data from the following tables into PGAdmin
cdc_db_cleaned_part1 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part2 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part3 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part4 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
household_income_by_state (into ST_INCOME),
state_factors_from_gallup (into US_POLITICS),
census_sex_no_covid (into CENSUS_SEX),
census_age_no_covid (into CENSUS_RACE)	


2.	We created the following tables in PGAdmin, from CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED:
DATA_AGE_GROUP (We identified the age group options:
age_group_0_17, age_group_18_49, age_group_50_64, age_group_65PLUS),

US_STATES(We identified the states, dropping DC),

DATA_SEX(We identified the sex options: MALE, FEMALE),

DATA_RACE (We identified the race options:
Asian, Black, Multiple/Other, White,
American Indian/Alaska Native,
Native Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander,
NO_IDENTIFIED_RACE)



3.	Using the table: US_STATES, we created COVID totals, of totals per state, from the table:CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED

------------------------
1ST calculated the totals for the age group
INSERT INTO AGE_GROUP
(
SELECT DISTINCT RES_STATE ST,AGE_GROUP, COUNT(DATA_ID) TOTAL_AGE
FROM CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED
GROUP BY RES_STATE, AGE_GROUP
)
------------------------
Calculated the sex totals

INSERT INTO SEX_GROUP
(
SELECT DISTINCT RES_STATE ST, SEX, COUNT(DATA_ID) TOTAL_SEX
FROM CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED
GROUP BY RES_STATE, SEX
)


------------------------
Calculated the race totals

INSERT INTO RACE_GROUP
(
SELECT DISTINCT RES_STATE ST,RACE,COUNT(DATA_ID) TOTAL_RACE
FROM CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED
GROUP BY RES_STATE, RACE
)
------------------------




4.	Using the table: US_STATES, and the calculated COVID totals, 
and created the table: COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS
(limited function of the SQL process due to limit of my personal laptop)
-----------------------

INSERT INTO COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS

-----------------------

5.	Using the table: US_STATES, we added all the tables with totals, 
and created the table: COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4
-----------------------


INSERT INTO COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4

LEFT JOIN
(SELECT ST, Total_SEX_population, sex_male_no_covid, sex_female_no_covid FROM NOCOVID_CENSUS_SEX) B
ON A.ST=B.ST
LEFT JOIN
(SELECT ST, Total_AGE_population, age_group_0_17_no_covid, age_group_18_49_no_covid, age_group_50_64_no_covid, age_group_65plus_no_covid

LEFT JOIN

------------------------------------------------

6.	We exported our table COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4 from PGAdmin to the csv file:
COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4


7.	In Excel, after the export, we had to do the following, to make the data even more representative

a.	remove NO_COVID_AGE_GROUP, and NO_COVID_SEX because they were null values
b.	rename Total_AGE_population to total_STATE_population
C.	remove Total_SEX_population because it had the same value as Total_AGE_population/total_COVID_ST_population
d.	remove DC data because it had too many nill values
e.	change the few other nill values to zero
f.	create the target variable: TARGET_VAR_COVID_NO_per_STATE from (total_COVID_ST_population / total_STATE_population)
g.	added the total_COVID_ST_population from the sum of COVID_sex_FEMALE, and COVID_sex_MALE,
h.	added total_noCOVID_ST_population from total_STATE_population-total_COVID_ST_population

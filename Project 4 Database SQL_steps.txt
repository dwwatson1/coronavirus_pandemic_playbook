1.	We input/imported data from the following tables into PGAdmin
cdc_db_cleaned_part1 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part2 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part3 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
cdc_db_cleaned_part4 (into CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED),
household_income_by_state (into ST_INCOME),
state_factors_from_gallup (into US_POLITICS),
census_sex_no_covid (into CENSUS_SEX),
census_age_no_covid (into CENSUS_RACE)	


2.	We created the following tables in PGAdmin, from CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED:
DATA_AGE_GROUP (We identified the age group options:
age_group_0_17, age_group_18_49, age_group_50_64, age_group_65PLUS),

US_STATES(We identified the states, dropping DC),

DATA_SEX(We identified the sex options: MALE, FEMALE),

DATA_RACE (We identified the race options)
ASIAN, BLACK, MULTIPLE_OTHER,WHITE,
AMERICAN_INDIAN_ALASKA_NATIVE,
NativeHawaiian_OtherPacificIslander


3.	Using the table: US_STATES, we created the table: COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_PROJECT4, 
of totals per state, with calculated data from the table:CDC_INPUTDB_CLEANED


4.	Using the table: US_STATES, we added all the tables with totals, 
and created the table: COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4


5.	We exported our table COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4 from PGAdmin to the csv file:
COVID_MARCH2020_DEC2020_TOTALS_PROJECT4
